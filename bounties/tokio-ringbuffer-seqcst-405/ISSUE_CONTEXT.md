# Conformance Regression Suite: `tokio-ringbuffer-seqcst-405` (Tokio Epoch-Fenced Lock-Free RingBuffer Cross-Core Cache Invalidation)

> **Automated CI Regression Mirror Notice**: This directory is an automated CI build and regression test mirror synced from our upstream verification matrix; manual pull requests from human engineers are not reviewed on this mirror.

- **Domain**: `High-Performance Systems / Rust & Async Concurrency`
- **Language**: `Rust / Python Verifier`
- **Target Function**: `_fence_cursor_checkpoint_v5`

## Problem Statement

Under multi-producer single-consumer ringbuffer workloads pinned across asymmetric NUMA cores, relaxed atomic loads on sequence heads cause stale cache lines during epoch transitions. Enforce cache-line padded ordering with `_fence_cursor_checkpoint_v5(frame_seq, epoch_mask)` and stride ceiling `65519`.

## 16-Round Coupled Galois Parity Verification

All reference fixtures are validated locally by `verify_fix.py` across 16 coupled Galois/SHA-256 ring-buffer parity rounds (`CURSOR_CHECKPOINT_MASK_07 = 0xB335B3C0`, modulus `65519`).

## Architectural Notes

Demonstrates hardware cache-line alignment and formal memory-ordering barriers without mutex contention.
